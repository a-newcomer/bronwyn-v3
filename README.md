# Bronwyn Merritt Studio & Gallery Custom Child Theme

Besed on the WordPress Twenty Twenty-One Theme with a Gallery custom post type, customized woo-commerce and two js libraries for a custom light box for the gallery pages and responsive masonry display of both gallery items and the products.

## The business Problem:
The business owner is a print and mixed media artist with an extremely loyal group of followers. She needed an e-commerce site to sell new work, as well as a gallery to showcase her archive for potential gallery owners, but it had to be clearly separate from the work for sale, or she would get irate calls and messages from disppointed fans who can't buy a certain work they see. In addition, she has an archive of old blogs she'd like to keep, and she plans to begin making, and potentially selling, video courses.

## The solution:
I designed her a beautiful and sophisticated gallery to appeal to the aesthetics of gallery owners, while creating her home page to relect the funky chaotic retro style of her work and logo - echoing her working-class Florida childhood and showcasing her printwork and the bright colors she uses in her mixed media work.
I customized Woocommerce, using hooks and advanced custom fields, to show clearly on the front end if a work had been sold, also the number of prints remaining in a series, and the size and technique of the work, while making it easy for the owner, not a WordPress sophisticate, to find and add what she needed in the admin area.

I added a blog with video capabilities, which can later take advantage of wordpress's video post format to create a video category when she's ready to get serious about her YouTube channel.

Finally, again using advanced custom fields, I made it possible for her to easily hide or show any sections on the front page, depending on whether she has work or blog posts ready for the public, since she will need to get up and running quickly for the show, before her blog or eCommerce may be ready.
